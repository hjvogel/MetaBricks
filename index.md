Start Coding Shared LEGO-Like (Token) Bricks for Building, Plug and Play!

-> Tokenize & Earn Twice!

 
Tokeni - What?

>> Rethink Coding!
How many times same code structures, logics + unit tests are copied or independently rewritten by lots of different developers spending high costs, energy and resources again and again – just doing very similar tasks? Why inventing the wheel again? >> Increase efficiency and quality by refining sustainable digital structures for re-use.
 
If you already produce computer code from small logics / data-/ infrastructure bits up to huge mainframe silos 
like others create art, think about to share, standard-interface it i.o. to resell tokenized parts of it 
by burning functional structures or just some graphics, sounds, logics, … of any abstraction level into an electronic token brick

- its "smart contract" structure. Test, certify, brand that and go out for the new token markets – things can only get better with global competition!

Help to build and refine reusable code & data structures in global competition incentivized by pay by use.

Brick-Frameworks are already here and cool to work with - but mostly not openly shared, interfaced nor borderless interoperable yet. 
Imagine these getting turned into 'code' token-bricks and globally refined, traded and more used 
like well-known LEGO bricks – for building any digital application, but powered at least twice by incentives – initial purpose and its token value:

Missing yet / even Demos:
After static images, the easiest meta code brick might be a simple if/else brick: Abstract in UML or in (Abstract) Java, Python, Basic, Machine Code… doesn't matter once a computer can execute it.
